    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <div style="text-align: left; width: 100%;">
        <p>Hello, my name is Mikhail Tarasevich, and I would like to introduce you to my pet projectâ€”a CRUD application
            aimed at digitalizing the university studying process.</p>
        <p>The application is structured into three layers. The first layer is the DAO layer, responsible for retrieving
            data from the database. Initially, the application utilized JdbcTemplate and direct SQL queries, but it has
            now transitioned to using Spring Data JPA. You can find a comprehensive history of the application's
            creation in the "about" tab.</p>
        <p>The second layer is the Service layer, which handles the internal logic of the application. It manages
            backend validation, transaction management, and interacts with the DAO layer to retrieve data.</p>
        <p>The third layer is the UI layer, responsible for receiving HTTP requests from users and mapping them to the
            relevant views, typically HTML pages. The UI layer adheres to the principles of the REST architecture.</p>
        <p>In summary, my CRUD application facilitates the digitalization of the university studying process.
            It incorporates a DAO layer for data retrieval, a Service layer for application logic, and a UI layer for
            handling user requests and generating appropriate views. If you have any further inquiries, please let
            me know!</p>

            remove any information. However, you can access all pages and see the relevant content.</p>
        <p>If you log in as a teacher, you will have additional rights to add new information to the app. You can
            contribute and update the content as needed within your designated privileges.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if you log in as an admin, you will have full control over the application. In addition to
            adding new information, you can also delete any unnecessary or outdated data.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, users have the option to register their own student or teacher accounts. By clicking on the
            registration link, you can create your own user account with the respective role. This allows you to
